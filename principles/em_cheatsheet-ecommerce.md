# Quince Interview Prep – Principles‑Aligned Cheat Sheet

*(Tailored to Quince Operating Principles & Leadership Expectations)*

---

## 1. Quince‑Specific 30‑Second Pitch

> **“I’m an Engineering Manager leading ML‑driven, consumer‑facing products in Search & Discovery. My focus is moving fast, testing early, and delivering measurable customer impact. I’ve led teams through zero‑to‑one launches, quality turnarounds, and cross‑functional execution where results matter more than optics. I’m excited about Quince because speed, rigor, and customer value are first‑class—and that’s how I like to operate.”**

---

## 2. How *You* Map to Quince Operating Principles

### We learn fast
- Run experiments instead of debates
- Bias toward shipping small, measurable changes
- Tight feedback loops (metrics, A/Bs, post‑launch reviews)

> **Sound bite:** “If we can’t test it quickly, we’re probably debating the wrong thing.”

---

### Results > optics
- Outcomes over effort or visibility
- Metrics define success, not narrative

> **Sound bite:** “I don’t manage effort—I manage outcomes.”

---

### Move with urgency
- Default to action with guardrails
- Fix forward instead of waiting for perfection

> **Sound bite:** “Speed fuels learning; we can always correct with data.”

---

### Radical candor
- Direct feedback early
- No surprises at review time

> **Sound bite:** “Clarity is kindness—especially when performance is drifting.”

---

### Customer‑first continuous improvement
- Every feature ties to a customer metric
- Quality framed as customer trust

> **Sound bite:** “Quality issues show up in code, but customers feel them immediately.”

---

### One team, low ego
- Shared ownership across product, design, ML
- Solve problems, not defend turf

> **Sound bite:** “If the metric wins, the team wins—credit is secondary.”

---

### Data‑driven & scrappy
- Make decisions with imperfect data
- Use constraints to force focus

> **Sound bite:** “Rigor doesn’t mean slow; it means knowing what *not* to do.”

---

### High quality at low price
- Challenge false tradeoffs (speed vs quality)
- Build leverage via tooling and process

> **Sound bite:** “I don’t accept speed versus quality as a binary—I push teams to break the tradeoff.”

---

## 3. Leadership Expectations → Your Proof Points

### Move fast, respond quickly
- Hands‑on when needed
- Short decision loops
- Clear ownership

### High‑low operator
- Set strategy via metrics and principles
- Stay close to PRs, incidents, and experiments

> **Line to use:** “I zoom out to align on direction, then zoom in where the risk is.”

---

### Visible impact
- Weekly progress that actually matters
- Demos tied to metrics, not features

---

### Build high‑performing teams
- Hire multipliers, not lone heroes
- Coach early, course‑correct fast

---

## 5. Reframed “Why Quince / Why Now”

> “Quince is at a stage where speed, learning, and customer trust compound quickly. I’m excited about applying my experience in ML‑driven search, experimentation, and quality discipline in an environment that values urgency, candor, and real results over optics.”

---

## 6. Questions That Signal Quince‑Level Leadership

Ask **1–2 only**:

- “Where does speed currently break down, even though urgency is valued?”
- “What tradeoff do leaders here most often challenge?”
- “What would visible impact look like for this role in the first 90 days?”

---

## 7. Final Answer Self‑Check (Quince Bar)

Before finishing any answer, ask:
- Does this show **speed + learning**?
- Did I reference a **real result**?
- Did I tie it to **customer impact**?

---

## 8. One‑Line Mental Model

> **“Move fast, learn faster, stay close to customers, and never hide behind process.”**
