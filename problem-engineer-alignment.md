# Management Action Plan – Addressing Team Feedback

This document translates the problems raised by Mike into **concrete, management-owned actions**.  
The goal is to reduce ambiguity, improve execution quality, and create a healthier delivery rhythm **without adding unnecessary process**.

---

## Key Management Themes

- Make goals and success criteria explicit before execution
- Gate work on *clarity*, not perfection
- Time-box ambiguity (UX, legal, requirements)
- Trade scope for quality intentionally
- Close the loop so the same problems don’t repeat

## Management Action Plan (Problem → Solution)

| # | Problem Area | Management Root Issue | Action Items (EM-Owned) | Expected Outcome |
|---|-------------|----------------------|-------------------------|------------------|
| 1 | Unclear project goals & context | Work starts without shared understanding of *why* and *success criteria* | • Require a short **Project Framing** (goal, metric, why now, non-goals)<br>• Re-brief team on **priority changes**<br>• Assign **metric owner** per project | Engineers understand intent, make better tradeoffs, less thrash |
| 2 | Requirements not finalized early | Engineering starts before legal/UX/product constraints are known | • Introduce **Ready-to-Build gate**<br>• Maintain **Known Unknowns** list with owners & deadlines<br>• Push back on demo-driven scope changes | Fewer mid-build pivots, clearer expectations |
| 3 | UX is a bottleneck | UX decisions are open-ended and late | • Front-load **directional UX decisions**<br>• Assign **UX decision owner**<br>• Time-box UX debates | Backend & FE unblock earlier, faster execution |
| 4 | Same issues repeat across projects | No process feedback loop | • Run lightweight **process post-mortems**<br>• Maintain **project smells checklist**<br>• Escalate early when patterns repeat | Systemic issues addressed once, not repeatedly |
| 5 | iOS quality & QA gaps | Deadlines compress QA and real-world testing | • Enforce **non-negotiable QA window**<br>• Trade scope for quality explicitly<br>• Assign **release quality owner** | Fewer prod bugs, more predictable releases |
| 6 | Backend env & dependency issues | FE blocked by unstable backend readiness | • Require **backend readiness confirmation** before FE QA<br>• Add backend readiness to **go/no-go**<br>• Make env ownership explicit | Fewer last-minute blocks, clearer accountability |
| 7 | Weak code review bar | Reviews optimize for speed, not quality | • Reset **review expectations** publicly<br>• Rotate **strict reviewer** role<br>• Reward strong review behavior | Higher quality code, issues caught earlier |
| 8 | Constant rush & unclear growth path | Pace prioritized over clarity and development | • Clarify **roles & expectations** per project<br>• Tie projects to **career growth signals**<br>• Intentionally slow down select initiatives | Higher trust, better long-term performance |
